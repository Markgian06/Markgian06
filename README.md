I have strengths in Web Development, currently working with HTML, CSS, and learning JavaScript for responsiveness. Additionally, I'm currently  learning in advancing my programming skills in Java and Python. I also excel in Graphic Design, using Adobe tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. My key attributes include Time Management, Adaptability, Problem Solving, and Collaborative abilities.
