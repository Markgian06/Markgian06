- Hi, I’m @Markgian06, I am excited to begin my journey as a bachelor of science in Information systems students. I have always  been interested in the world of programming. I have strengths in Web Development, currently working with HTML, CSS, and learning JavaScript for responsiveness. Additionally, I'm currently  learning in advancing my programming skills in Java and Python. I also excel in Graphic Design, using Adobe tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. My key attributes include Time Management, Adaptability, Problem Solving, and Collaborative abilities.
